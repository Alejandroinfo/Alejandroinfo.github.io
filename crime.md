## Description
This project presents crime data. The information is organized into categories (criminal damage, drug minor offenses, other offenses, theft, and violent crime)
and we take a look at the several variables that could determine when and where
crime is ocurring
- Objective: Provide a clear and accessible view of the composition of crimes in a given area or period.
- Value: Highlights dominant patterns (for example, the prevalence of theft and violent crime) and serves as a foundation for discussions on public safety and prevention policies.
