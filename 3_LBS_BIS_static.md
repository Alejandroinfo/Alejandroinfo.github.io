## Data
The locational banking statistics (LBS) measure international banking activity from a residence perspective, focusing on the location of the banking office.  The LBS capture the outstanding claims (financial assets) and liabilities of internationally active banks located in reporting countries on counterparties residing in more than 200 countries. Banks record their positions on an unconsolidated basis, including intragroup positions between offices of the same banking group. The LBS capture around 95% of all cross-border banking activity.

The data is published in US dollars, quarterly, with timeseries since 1980 and it is accesible through API. I am planning to use timeseries since 2000 and end-date of 2024. This dataset contains the cross-country expositions.

In particular, for the static visualization we are working with a subset of the series, filtered in the website and retrieved with the API specific link.
